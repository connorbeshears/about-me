Connor - 1

I am senior working on my BS in Computer Science.

This summer I interned as a software developer intern at Commerce Bank in Kansas City, and continue that role remotely throughout the semester. I am originally from Kansas City, and will return there after college. 

After I graduate, I will be starting full time at Commerce Bank as an Associate Developer, and will continue education by getting a certificate of ministry in worship leading, through Evangel University.

I have a huge passion for game development and I am the current ACM president
