## About
This page is being used to demonstrate key understanding of git concepts in the context of web development. It will also provide information and tools to get started with git and web development.

## Recommended Tools

 - [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
 - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    - note: There are plenty of extensions and tools that can be optionally downloaded into VS Code that are highly recommended.

## Recommended Resources
 - [Git tutorial](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial)
 This tutorial is a comprehensive and deep tutorial on git, and explains very well what the tool is capable of.
 
 - [Markdown tutorial](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
 This is a great guide from GitHub on how to edit .md or markdown files, which is what this page is using right now. Great place to start when creating a .md readme or guide for your git repo

 - [React Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)
 This is a tutorial on how to use React JS, a javascript framework from Facebook that makes web development fun and easy. I highly recommend this framework as it's easy to use and Facebook has made loads of documentation if you get stuck.
